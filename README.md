# CMake C App Template

A template for a single-project program written in C, with CMake as the build tool.

The aim is to expose certain elements of cross-platform C application development
that most developers may find useful, for example:

- devcontainers
- Visual Studio Code extension recommendations and settings
- GitHub workflows
- CMakePresets.json, with a unified output folder for all IDEs
- Descriptive executable names, can be tweaked to be ready for shipping
-
